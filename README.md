# Yummy App

Angular front-end for the Yummy Application.

### Testing
Having an issue with code not working?
A code linter is your best friend!

**Here's how to setup the recommended code linter**

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org)
2. Run `npm install --global eslint eslint-config-xo`

**To test the code**

Run `eslint .`

**Don't like debugging from the CLI?**

The linter can [integrate into your favorite editor](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations)

Enjoy :smile:
